            <p class="description_general"> Self-report user interface design patterns for people with rheumatic
                conditions was created as a
                master's dissertation in Fraunhofer Portugal AICOS. The dissertation was done in the context of the
                Master in Design and Multimedia, advised by Paula Alexandra Silva and Francisco Nunes and presented to
                the Department of Informatics Engineering of the Faculty of Sciences and Technology of the University of

                    <h3>Problem scope</h3>
                    <p>Existing self-report apps for people with rheumatic conditions are not designed with these
                        people's
                        characteristics in mind.</p>

                    <h3>Motivation</h3>
                    <p>Rheumatic conditions require regular follow-ups with clinicians and patients must engage in
                        self-care for a long period of time. This self-care can be done with the help of self-report
                        apps.</p>

            <h3>Objectives</h3>
            <p class="objective">Uncover UI components used in existing self-report mobile apps and create
                evidence-based design patterns for self-report apps for people with rheumatic conditions. The research
                was divided into
                three phases: a systematic review of self-report apps, usability experiments with end-users to test
                the UI components, and the creation of evidence-based design patterns.</p>

            <h4>BACKGROUND</h4>
            <div class="back1">
                <h3>Research stages</h3>
                <p>This research focuses on three of the most common rheumatic conditions, namely Rheumatic Arthritis,
                    Osteoarthritis and Psoratic Arthritis. Even though all three types of rheumatic conditions affect
                    the joints of a person with a rheumatic condition, their causes are distinct. Two of the most
                    prevalent symptoms of these conditions are pain and swelling of the joints. These symptoms influence
                    their dexterity, which has an impact on how they engage with technology. As a result, paying
                    attention to app design is crucial for increasing usability, adherence and therapeutic outcomes.
                    There are some obstacles to overcome to provide apps that meet the expectations of users, such as
                    hand pain and disability, accessibility and technical ability. There are guidelines provided by W3C,
                    Google Material Design and Apple Human Interface Guidelines that must be followed to enable people
                    with these conditions to operate their devices.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="back2">
                <h3>Design patterns</h3>
                <p>Design patterns are standard reference points for the experienced designer. They are reusable
                    solutions to commonly occurring problems in a context, repeatedly applied to similar problems
                    encountered in different contexts. Design patterns provide a common language between designers.
                    Reusing design patterns provides general solutions documented in a format that does not require
                    specifics tied to a particular problem. <br><br> One of the benefits of mobile app design patterns
                    is helping to eliminate user experience risks since the pattern is tested before, not to need
                    alternative and uncertain solutions. The other benefit is that that allows predictability. Patterns
                    provide the user with a feeling of familiarity to enjoy the product without the necessity to waste
                    time learning how to interact with the app.</p>

                    <h3>App review results</h3>
                    <p>The aim of the mobile app review and selection is to explore commonly used interfaces in
                        self-report mobile apps for people with rheumatic conditions. The results of the app review are
                        divided in: characteristics, features and UI components present in the apps included. The end
                        output of this phase is to discover and select the UI components that, besides complying with
                        existing guidelines, are also the most commonly used in commercial mobile apps. The selected UI
                        components will be included in the usability experiments based on the Android and iOS guidelines
                        and to detail the validation with experts. <br><br>
                        App search was conducted on the two leading mobile app stores: Android Google Play Store, which
                        caters to Android devices and iOS Apple App Store, which hosts mobile apps for iOS
                        devices.<br><br>

                    <p>The focus of the analysis was to uncover main UI components used, but the features of the apps
                        and general app characteristics were also analysed. Analysis was iterative and aligned with the
                        thematic analysis technique.
                        <br><br>
                        This analysis was conducted in Excel and resulted in a table composed of 94 columns, organised
                        by three domains: assessment measures, codes of the features available and the UI components
                        present in the apps.

                    <h3>Features of the apps included</h3>
                    <p>The features of the apps were organised, according to the codes: educational information, general
                        wellbeing monitoring, possibility of triggering self-report, functional capacity monitoring,
                        quality of life monitoring, exercise management, triggers, medical management, information
                        sharing, health events, notes/comments and symptom tracking.
                        <br><br>
                        Based on the results obtained, it was possible to conclude that most apps lack key features to
                        assist the self-report of rheumatic conditions such as quality of life, functional capacity and
                        sharing of the information tracked. Only 4 out of the apps reviewed provided at least 8 features
                        to support patients in managing their condition: Arthritis+Patient, Elsa, My arthritis and RA
                        Manager.

                        One of the goals of this dissertation was to review self-report apps for people with rheumatic
                        conditions. Therefore the review of symptoms tracking was done in more depth to identify which
                        symptoms are most commonly tracked.

                <h3>RECOMMENDED SLIDER CHARACTERISTICS FOR SLIDERS *</h3>
                <p>...you've reached the point in the project where you must make decisions about the appropriate slider
                    characteristics for sliders. The sliders' properties are significant since they will affect whether
                    users may observe and pick a value (or range) from the slider, as well as perform relevant actions
                    and activities along with the flow of your UI.

                <p class="bold">Selecting a slider with the most appropriate characteristics for a specific group of
                    users required a thorough study of their unique characteristics, expecta- tions and preferences. For
                    certain populations such as those with rheumatic conditions, official UI guidelines such as Google
                    Material Design and Apple iOS Human Interface Guidelines do not provide recommendations in picking a
                    specific element group of characteristics for sliders. Value labels and tick marks are optional,
                    according to the official guidelines (Google, 2014).<br><br></p>
                <p>To create a more comfortable and enjoyable user experience, sliders should be designed to match the
                    special demands of people with rheumatic conditions. Since, patients with rheumatic diseases have
                    hand discomfort and disability, which limits how mobile devices can be utilised, for example, by
                    making data input difficult or requiring coarse precision (Mollard and Michaud, 2019).
                    <br><br>
                    Previous research has explored the effects of sliders affects the offset errors when users input
                    data (Colley et al., 2019) and (Zaina et al., 2022) found that sliders with continuous control can
                    have a harmful effect as, often, it becomes difficult to select a specific value in a large
                    interval.
                    <br><br>
                    Accordingly, our own work revealed that participants were quicker with sliders with a moving value
                    label. For this type of slider characteristic, participants' mean task completion time was 41%
                    faster than with sliders with tick marks and 10% faster than with sliders a static value label.
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, our research also studied the performance of sliders with tick marks. The results
                    showed that the value label is necessary, nonetheless, the use of tick marks assists the user,
                    therefore, this characteristic can also be included when designing sliders for people with rheumatic
                    conditions. Regarding the position of the slider on the screen, our research found that position was
                    not a determinant factor of performance, thus, making the position of the slider an option for the
                    designer/developer. Furthermore, the recommended slider thumb size of the slider (20dp) was revealed
                    to be sufficient for users with rheumatic conditions.
                    <br><br>
                    Therefore...<br><br>
                </p>
                <p class="bold">For sliders that require a high level of efficiency, sliders should be designed with a
                    moving value label. The incorporation of tick marks and the position of the slider on the screen are
                    optional and a slider thumb size as recommended by official guidelines is adequate.</p>

                <h3>RECOMMENDED SELECTORS *</h3>
                <p>...you are now in a phase of the project where decisions need to be made regarding adequate size for
                    selectors. Choosing selectors' size is an important decision as it will determine the levels of
                    comfort, and efficiency with which your users are able to complete necessary actions and tasks
                    throughout the flow of your UI.
                    <br><br>
                    +++ <br><br>
                </p>
                <p class="bold">Choosing a selector's size for a given group of users requires a thorough understanding
                    of their particular characteristics, expectations, and preferences. Official UI guidelines such as
                    Google Material Design and Apple iOS Human Interface Guidelines do not provide guidance in choosing
                    a selector's size for specific groups such as people with rheumatic conditions. Although W3C
                    provides a succession criteria on target sizes being large enough for users to easily activate them,
                    this criteria does not recommend a specific target size for people with rheumatic
                    conditions.<br><br></p>
                <p>Previous research has explored the use of large icons and buttons to improve accessibility for users
                    with dexterity impairments (Parmanto and Brad, 2019) and (Yu et al., 2017) found that users with a
                    higher degree of dexterity impairment demonstrated more problems in task completion and prefer the
                    use of larger buttons. Consequently, most guidelines that are currently available do not aid
                    designers in creating smartphone UIs that adequately respond to people with rheumatic conditions
                    specific characteristics.
                    <br><br>
                    It is known that the severity of hand impairment, dexterity, movement control, hand coordination,
                    and limited hand mobility increases as rheumatic diseases worsen citepMollard2021. These conditions
                    can have a significant impact on movement, resulting in symptoms like pain, stiffness, rigidity and
                    sluggish movement (Mollard and Michaud, 2019). Selectors are therefore more difficult to select when
                    their size is reduced.
                    <br><br>
                    Inevitably, accurately acquiring small targets becomes increasingly difficult as the conditions
                    progress. Providing targets that are too small makes a UI more difficult to use and could result in
                    frustration and anxiety among people with rheumatic conditions (Czaja and Sharit, 1998) and should
                    therefore be avoided.
                    <br><br>
                    Furthermore, our own research revealed that people with rheumatic conditions took less time to
                    select an option in 56dp size column selectors when these had an in-between button spacing of 24dp,
                    where the registered mean completion times of this in-between target was 1.88 seconds.
                    <br><br>
                    Accordingly, our own research revealed that for larger in-between buttons spacing there is a
                    significance for larger dimensions of selectors (1.25x larger than recommended - 70dp). However,
                    since this significance is very low, which indi- cates this dimension is not crucial for bettering
                    user performance. Additionally, the size recommended by the official guidelines does not behave very
                    differently from a larger size, therefore, the size recommended by the official guidelines for
                    selectors can be used. Thus, ideally, a selector's size should be larger than the recommended by
                    official guidelines, nonetheless, the recommenced size also works for people with rheumatic
                    conditions. Additionally, in-line selectors were also studied, so we can say that regardless of
                    whether the selectors are in a row or in a column, the recommendations are the same.
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, our own research revealed that people with rheumatic conditions took less time to
                    select an option in column selectors with the official guidelines recommended size (56dp) when these
                    had an in-between button spacing of 24dp (2x larger than the recommended by official guidelines),
                    where the registered mean task completion time of this in-between target was 1.88 seconds.
                    Additionally, our research showed that, even without significance, ideally, as selectors' sizes
                    increase, so should the in-between button spacing.
                    <br><br>
                    The results show that with the increase of the size there should be a increase of the in-between
                    button spacing. However, the differences observed are small. Additionally, even without
                    significance, ideally, as selectors' sizes increase, so should the in-between button spacing,
                    however, probably the smaller in-between button spacing works in case of space restrictions.
                    <br><br>
                    Therefore...<br><br>
                </p>
                <p class="bold">For people with rheumatic conditions, selectors' size should be 1.5x larger than
                    recommended (70dp) with an in-between button spacing 2x larger than recommended (24dp). Otherwise,
                    the size and in-between button spacing recommended by the official guidelines - size (56dp) and

                <h3>RECOMMENDED SELECTORS *</h3>
                <p>...you are now in a phase of the project where decisions need to be made regarding adequate selector
                    size for a body graphic. Choosing a selector's size for a body graphic is an important decision as
                    it will determine the levels of self-report quality, accuracy and comfort with which your users are
                    able to get things done on your interface.

                </p>
                <p class="bold">As a result of the increase in rheumatic diseases in today's society, sensory and
                    psychomotor abilities deteriorate and these changes may make selector sizes for a body graphic
                    obsolete. Furthermore, present smartphone user interface guidelines do not address specialized
                    groups, such as persons with rheumatic diseases.<br><br></p>
                <p>Previous research has explored the use of large icons and buttons to improve accessibility for users
                    with dexterity impairments (Parmanto and Brad, 2019) and (Yu et al., 2017) found that users with a
                    higher degree of dexterity impairment demonstrated more problems in task completion and prefer the
                    use of larger buttons. Consequently, most guidelines that are currently available do not aid
                    designers in creating smartphone UIs that adequately respond to people with rheumatic conditions
                    specific characteristics.
                    <br><br>
                    People with rheumatic conditions have dexterity problems caused by swollen joints, hand pain, or
                    deformation of the fingers. Many self-monitoring appli- cations for rheumatic conditions focus on
                    what are known as PROs (patient- reported outcomes) (Mollard and Michaud, 2021). The tracking of
                    symptoms, such as the assessment of the joints, is one of the main features of these apps (Yuqing
                    and Hong, 2021). Usually, apps that use body graphics with selectors to assess joints present an
                    overview of the human body with the possibility of selecting different joints.
                    <br><br>
                    Official UI guidelines such as Google Material Design and Apple iOS Human Interface Guidelines do
                    not provide guidance in choosing a size for the selectors in the body graphics for specific groups
                    such as people with rheumatic con- ditions. Official smartphone Android Material Design guidelines
                    recommend minimum toggle buttons to be 24dp, raising issues such as selector occlusion while
                    performing a gesture and/or accidentally touching a neighbouring selector.
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, people with rheumatic conditions have limited movement control, hand coordination, and
                    hand movement (Grainger and Al, 2020), which affects their precision and the way they interact with
                    smartphones.
                    <br><br>
                    Accordingly, our own research revealed that people with rheumatic conditions took less time to
                    select the right part of the body graphic when these had a selector size of 48dp, where the
                    registered mean task completion times of this size selectors were 2.35 seconds. Participants were
                    70% faster in comparison with a body graphic with selectors with the recommended.
                    <br><br>
                    Therefore...<br><br>
                </p>
                <p class="bold">For people with rheumatic conditions performing tasks that require high- performance
                    measures in a body graphic, design selectors with a size of 56dp (2x the recommended by official
                    guidelines).</p>

            <h4>THE TAKEAWAY </h4>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>This work researched what adaptations are required in order to design self-report applications for people
                with rheumatic conditions, providing interfaces that people with these conditions will be able to use.
                The research was done in the scope of a project of Fraunhofer Portugal AICOS, a project that intends to
                create a mobile solution that enables holistic and efficient patient monitoring, for clinical care and
                drug trials.
                <br><br>
                Our research revealed that current smartphone UI components are not immediately usable by people with
                rheumatic conditions. However, in many cases, the official recommendations about the UI components are
                compatible and adequate for people with rheumatic conditions, as is the case of the slider thumb size in
                horizontal and vertical sliders e the in-line selector sizes.
