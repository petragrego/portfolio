                    <p>Health Professionals are constantly subject to high levels of stress in the work context.
                        Burnout, a syndrome characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and low
                        professional fulfillment, is one of the main results. Currently, we are witnessing its
                        trivialization and stigmatization, which sensitized us to make this the focus of our project.

                   <p> Cuidar de ti is a service that aims to help healthcare professionals who are in burnout or have high
                    levels of stress. The service consists of an app and two physical spaces. The app aims to support
                    health professionals through contact with other people who are going through the same and also allow
                    them to have moments of relaxation throughout their working day. The app allows healthcare
                    professionals to access to physical spaces, namely the Relax Room and the Exercise Room. These have
                    as main objective to give health professionals a place to relax or to exercise, in order to get away
                    from the stress experienced in their work.

                        <h3>Desk research</h3>
                        <p>Initially, a desk research was carried out in which several websites, videos and articles
                            were consulted that addressed various health problems of health professionals in order to
                            understand which problem we should address in this project.
                            <br><br>
                            Desk research revealed that:<br>
                            1) There is an inherent need for excessive productivity;<br>
                            2) There is a stigma/taboo regarding Burnout;<br>
                            3) The main factors that lead a Health Professional to reach the maximum of exhaustion are
                            inadequate ratios and the deontological duty to care and help;<br>
                            4) There is no concern, within the Medical Units, to break the tension and stress caused by
                            work;

                        <h3>Field research</h3>
                        <p>After the desk research, the field research took place. The field research was carried out
                            through an interview with several health professionals or people related to them, and a form
                            filled out by health professionals on the subject of burnout. These two activities made it
                            possible to corroborate the information gathered from desk research.
                            <br><br>
                            The interviews were carried out with 6 people: a nurse, a medical student, a nursing
                            student, a nurse's daughter, a doctor and a senior nurse. In this interview, the
                            participants were asked about the difficulties felt at work, the stigma about burnout, the
                            impact that covid had on their lives, the pressure and excessive effort in the profession.
                            <br><br>
                            The form was filled out by 12 health professionals with different professions and functions.
                            This form questioned the experience of burnout in their work environment, and ways of
                            relieving or helping to combat it.
                            <br><br>
                            This field research allowed us to deepen our knowledge about burnout in healthcare
                            professionals and to understand what would be the best possible service to help fight
                            bournout.
