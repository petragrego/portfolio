            <p class="description_general"> Develop the way you think as a designer was created by a group pf three
                designers with a strong belief in design as a problem-solving tool. As Master’s Designer students we
                create work we love and belief in. This project, called “Develop the way you think as a designer”, was
                born in our Communication Design subject at FCTUC (Faculty od Sciences and Technology, University of
                Coimbra).</p>

                        practice of design, we will attack the problem in those who practice it.</p>

                    in the context of project development (initial phase of the project/brainstorming). The main

                    is to stimulate the application of the different intelligences (PACES) in this procedure. Provide

                    <h3>Concept</h3>
                    <p>Having a wide variety of perspectives at the table throughout the design process allows us to
                        design more inclusive experimences for a broader audience. The key for a good design is
                        diversity. Nowadays, traditional design education models focus primarilt on formgiving and not
                        enough attention is given to teaching students about how design functions in broder contexts,
                        why it is culturally relevant, and how and why it now has the widespreas economic, political,
                        environmental and technological impacts that it does. This project allows users to develop the
                        way they thing as designers, providing a varied set of references (videos, podcasts, books,
                        magazines, articles and webpabes) for each of the five itellegences explored, though the use of
                        a deck of cards and a website.
                        <br><br>
                        “An overview of Multiple Intellegence theories is procided to supposr a proposed framework for
                        design education called the PACES Multiple Intelligences Model for Design (PACES = Pactical,
                        Analytical, Creative, Emotional, and Social). PACES components can be effectively applied to
                        supposr the needs of conteporary design educators and sutudents shared.” in a Multiple
                        Intelligences Model for Design by Dennis M. Cheatham.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Operating circuit</h3>
                    <p>1) The first contact with these resources is made through the website. Regarding editorial
                        support, the deck is composed of different cards grouped together. These are identified by
                        different colors that distinguish and stimulate the different types of intelligences in the
                        design process. In this way, the designer has the possibility to exercise a single intelligence
                        or work them randomly as a team. Thus, communication and knowledge sharing are encouraged,
                        making the process more dynamic.
                        <br><br>
                        2) The use of the deck of cards is complemented by navigation on the website. This allows
                        designers to access various information, tools and references categorized by intelligence,
                        enabling a better understanding of their application.
